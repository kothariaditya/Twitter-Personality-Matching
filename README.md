# Twitter-Personality-Matching

This project uses [Twitter's Python API](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) & [IBM Watson's Personality Insights API](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/personality-insights-python) to compare the personalities of two Twitter users and find their 5 most similar personality traits.

I used the Twitter API to query for the last 200 tweets (including RTs) of a user and then sent them to IBM Watson to analyze.

This was part of my investment days project (where we had to explore a field we're interested in) at [Influitive](https://influitive.com).
